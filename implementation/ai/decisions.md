# Decisions

This file records decisions that constrain implementation. Treat entries here as
binding until explicitly superseded.

When a human answers questions in [answers.md](/implementation/user/answers.md),
the agent should:

1. Append a decision record here.
2. Remove the answered question(s) from
   [questions.md](/implementation/user/questions.md).
3. Remove the accepted answer(s) from
   [answers.md](/implementation/user/answers.md).

## Decision log

No questions have been asked, and so no decisions have been made yet.
