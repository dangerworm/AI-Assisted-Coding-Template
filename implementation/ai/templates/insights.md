## Guidance for future readers

- Treat this as a **signal amplifier**, not a source of truth
- Items here may be speculative or partially understood
- Cross-check against specification and design docs before acting
- When an insight becomes a decision, move it to the appropriate document

## Notes

- This log is expected to contain false starts and dead ends
- That is a feature, not a bug
- Silence here usually indicates lack of reflection, not lack of risk
