# Answers (interpreted decisions)

This document is to capture decisions made in response to
[questions.md](./questions.md), in a form that an AI coding agent can treat as
binding constraints.

When the AI agent has asked questions and on the next run discovers that the
answers file has suitably answered a question or questions, it is expected that
the AI will:

- append these answers into [decisions.md](../ai/decisions.md)
- remove accepted answers from [answers.md](./answers.md)
- remove answered questions from [questions.md](./questions.md)
- reformat/reorder the headings in [questions.md](./questions.md)

> **The below content shows an example format.**
